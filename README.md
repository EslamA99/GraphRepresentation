This program is about Maximum Flow and Dijkstra Graph Algorithms using Jung2Liberary GUI.
For more explanation see this PDF
[Graph Represntation.pdf](https://github.com/eslam11993377/GraphRepresentation1/files/10108601/Graph.Represntation.pdf)
in this PDF I explain Maximum Flow and Dijkstra Graph Algorithms in detail and the GUI program in pictures.
It is more like documentation for the program.
